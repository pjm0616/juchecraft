This is JucheCraft, a simple parody game-like program.
You can move, attack, and duplicate units!
It was my term project for OOP class.
* Note: I don't like Kim Il-sung's `Juche', It's just a parody!

This program uses StarCraft resources. You'll need a copy of Starcraft to run this program.
It runs on linux and windows. However, you cannot compile resources on Windows, so you need a linux system anyway.

License: GNU GPL v3 or later. see LICENSE for details.

Dependencies:
	SDL, SDL_ttf, SDL_image, SDL_gfx, zlib, bz2, libncursesw(if you want ncurses interface) 

Building:
	* You need a 32bit system(or cross compile it) to compile the resources. (ShadowFlare's mpq library does not support 64bit)
	* Current build system is just terrible. It may not work on the future.
	$ mkdir ../mini_sc_data
	Copy StarDat.mpq, BrooDat.mpq, patch_rt.mpq (from StarCraft) into ../mini_sc_data/
	$ make

Building (using cmake):
	$ cd cmake
	$ make

Running:
	$ ./mini_sc
	or with ncurses UI:
	$ ./mini_sc ncurses

On windows:
	1. make resources on a *32bit* linux machine.
	2. copy the compiled resources(`res' directory) to windows.
	3. open msvc\mini_sc.sln (with MSVC 2008/2010)
